# somaticvariantdetector
An analysis pipeline that transforms whole genome sequencing data (.bam) into images then uses a convolutional neural network to predict presence and position of somatic variants; inspired by Googleâ€™s DeepVariant model. For a Machine Learning for Functional Genomics Masters level course at Columbia University.
