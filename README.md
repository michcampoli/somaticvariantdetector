# somaticvariantdetector
An analysis pipeline that transforms whole genome sequencing data (.bam) into images then uses a convolutional neural network to predict presence and position of somatic variants; inspired by Googleâ€™s DeepVariant model. Created for a Machine Learning for Functional Genomics Masters level course at Columbia University.

The data was downloaded from Illumina Platinum Genomes (https://www.illumina.com/platinumgenomes.html), sample NA12878 S1 from the 7 member CEPH pedigree 1463.
